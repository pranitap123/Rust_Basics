## Why It Fails
The code fails because of Rust's borrowing rules: you cannot have a mutable reference while an immutable reference exists.

let word = first_word(&s); creates an immutable reference (word) that points to the data inside s.

s.clear(); tries to create a mutable reference to change s.

println!(...{word}); uses the immutable reference word.

Because word is needed after s.clear() is called, its immutable borrow is still active. 
Rust forbids the mutable borrow from s.clear() to prevent a bug where word would be left pointing to empty, invalid data. */

/*## How to Fix It âœ…
To fix this, you must ensure that the immutable borrow is finished before you try to create a mutable one. 
The easiest way is to use word and then modify's. */

fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &s[..]
}

fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello world");

    let word = first_word(&s);

    // Use the immutable borrow 'word' first.
    println!("the first word is: {word}");

    // The 'word' variable is no longer used after the println!,
    // so its immutable borrow ends here. Now it's safe to
    // take a mutable borrow.
    s.clear(); 

    println!("The string s is now: '{s}'");
}
//This version compiles and runs successfully because the scope of the immutable borrow (word) ends after the println!, allowing the mutable borrow (s.clear()) to proceed safely.
